# Using Clients in Pinepods

There's client versions of Pinepods for Linux (Deb, RPM, AppImage, Flatpak, AUR), Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS. Scroll down for install instructions. 

### Linux Client Install :computer:

#### AppImage, Fedora/Red Hat Derivative/Debian based (Ubuntu)

Any of the client additions are super easy to get going. First head over to the releases page on Github

https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/PinePods/releases

Grab the latest linux release. There's an appimage, a deb, and an rpm. Use the appimage if you aren't using a debian or red hat based distro. Change the permissions if using the appimage version to allow it to run.

```
sudo chmod +x pinepods.appimage
```

^ The name of the app file will vary slightly based on the version so be sure you change it or it won't work.

For the rpm or deb version just run and install

Once started you'll be able to sign in with your username and password. The server name is simply the url you browse to to access the server.

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Install the Pinepods Client right from the AUR! Replace the command below with your favorite aur helper

paru -S pinepods
```
